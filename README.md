# digital-restaurant-menu
@digital-restaurant-menu is a simple digital menu for restaurants that automatically loads product names and prices from a public Google Sheet.
The menu updates in real-time as the spreadsheet is modified, making it easy for restaurant owners to manage their offerings without touching code.
